ScreenshotCopy.ps1

    Goal:
        The purpose of this script is to screenshot a screen and save a file of the screenshot to a specific location.
        This is agnostic and will take a picture by leveraging .NET capabilities, ignoring any screenshot functions within programs themselves.

    Audience:
        Automation-oriented screenshotters.

    Version:
        8/17/2022 - Original version
        8/27/2022 - Code block for sound to screenshot and upload
        8/28/2022 - Added logic to 'stage' picture instead of saving it in destination directory to prevent iCloud sync confusion

    Return Codes:
        Success - 0
        Failure - 1
