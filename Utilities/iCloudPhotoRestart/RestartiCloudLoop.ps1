RestartiCloudLoop.ps1

    Goal:
        The purpose of this script is to actually make iCloud Photo uploads consistent from a Windows machine.
        I'm not sure if you use an iPhone with iCloud for your cloud photo storage while also managing pictures from Windows computers... but if you have, you know it's not great.
        If you've struggled like me (seeing it behave inconsistently, downright not working at times), then this script might help you. It does the following:

        - Creates a neverending loop which
            - Stops iCloud Services 
            - Stops iCloud Photos
            - Starts iCloud Services
            - Starts iCloud Photos
            - Waits 5 minutes
            - Goes to your Uploads and deletes everything inside
            - Restarts the loop

        The reason why is because the only way I found iCloud on Windows to work consistently was with starting and stopping it very regularly.
        The 5 minute delay is to give your device time to receive photos and actually upload them. If you find photos on your phone that you'd rather delete... they'll come back if still in the uploads folder after a service restart - which is why this deletes them from 'Uploads' each go around.

        My use-case was for a Dance Dance Revolution machine with a button to take a photo and save into Uploads. I figure this could be useful for similar utility machine use-cases or even just general better behavior for photographers or others who need Windows and iCloud for a workflow.

    Audience:
        People who use iCloud Photos on a Windows device and need uploads to be more regular/consistent.
